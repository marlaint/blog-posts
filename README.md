We were ~~having~~ ~~trying to~~ failing at having a normal family night, with a short spritual lesson followed by a treat and games. This time thing one, bug and robot were pretty chill and attentive, but Monkey was another story. She could not stop talking. **Literally.** She was about seven at the time and I remember we had to take turns holding her with her arms pinned and a hand over her mouth just to make it through the lesson. Thankfully she was not offended, that would have started a meltdown that would have put a stop on the whole evening. She thought it was funny and did understand our predicament. But still she could not sit still or stop talking.

Flash forward a few years. Robot is in middle school, which is always one of the hardest periods of childhood. In what seems like overnight but must have been actually a month or two he morphs from a happy go lucky kid, outgoing, affectionate and always happy to reclusive, sullen and eventually suicidal. He was constantly on a computer, video game or his phone. If you tried to take away all three he'd just go to sleep for the rest of the day. His grades plummeted. For the next five and a half years he would struggle through major depression, anxiety and ptsd. He would tell stories of beating someone up that just could not be true. Bless his heart but he was a beanpole without an ounce of muscle on him. As a sophomore in high school he would lie and say he'd drank bleach, and then spend the rest of the evening in the emergecy room hoping to be admitted to the psych ward. But the result was only everyone finding out that there was no indication of bleach in his system.

When these types of behaviors are found in the same individual they are an indication of Bipolar Disorder. The National Institute of Mental Health classifies Bipolar as "a brain disorder that causes unusual shifts in mood, energy, activity levels, and the ability to carry out day-to-day tasks."[1](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/bipolar-disorder/index.shtml)

I'm finding it very hard to write these posts, as clinical as they are supposed to be, just defining the various disorders for you. I have to stop and go away every so often because my heart literally hurts just dealing with or thinking about it, even in this disconnected fashion. But it's very important. To understand this blog, these posts, my humor, my family, you need to understand where we are coming from and what the diseases are and aren't. 
Bipolar has no cure, but is caused by some mixture of genetics, environment, and altered brain chemistry/functioning. It can be dormant and only surface later in life, as for me when my psychosis triggered it at the age of 31. Yeah, an emotional or physically traumatic event or such can start it up.  But usually it rears its ugly head somewhere in adolescence; around 50% of cases occur before age 25. [2](https://health.usnews.com/health-news/patient-advice/articles/2015/01/15/bipolar-disorder-what-you-need-to-know) People with Bipolar disorder experience periods of intense emotion that involve sleep patterns, energy levels and coping abilities, to name a few. The depressive end we are all familiar with. Lack of interest in normal activities. Irregular sleeping patterns - either they can't sleep or they sleep too much. They have no energy and feel hopeless and lost. People with Bipolar have a suicide rate 60 times higher than that of the international poplulation rate. [3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16816785) these are most likely to occur during a major depressive episode or a mixed episode. When thing one, who has Bipolar type I, was in high school she wrote on her wall a list of ways to kill herself. And she actually tried five times. 
The details of the manic side are a little less well known.
I can't tell you how many people have said to me variations of "Well, if it was my kids, I would just  *insert favorite discipline here*."

I have been in a depression lately. I haven't really been in one that lasted more than an afternoon in several years.   
We have definitely, without denial, become "that family".   
According to [webmd](http://www.webmd.com/bipolar-disorder/guide/understanding-bipolar-disorder-symptoms) impulse control is a symptom of bipolar.  
Now, it's gotten to the point that whenever anything goes wrong, everyone just assumes it's my kids. Oh, money went missing- must be her kids. Is there a kid flunking all his classes, putting holes in the walls, or getting cross-faded? Must be that family. The problem is- *they're right.* ![shame](http://psychology.iresearchnet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Shame-300x250.jpg)
